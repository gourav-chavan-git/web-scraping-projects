I can't wrap my head around the task of finding instances of a pattern in a sequence.

I have a sequence with class labels where 0 are irrelevant and numbers from 1 to 15 represent categories.

First of all I have to admit, that I do not know if the problem I am facing is similar to a TSP or completely different.

  
First, I'll try to explain the problem:

There are let'say 7 travelling ""salesmen"" and 7 cities they should visit. So far no problem at all, but they should make 7 visits, one in each city. But only one salesman at once.

This is also not the problem, lets do it this way:

Round 1:

S1->C1

S2->C2

...

S7->C7

Round 2:

S1->C2

S2->C3

S7->C1
